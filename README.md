# Update
I was able to remove the "View more" from the tiles inside the categories
Curiously, I can't find a way to remove it from the Tiles themselves

# To be solved
1. Images on the category tiles still missing
2. Way to present the posts inside a category not good (no big tiles needed)
3. Trouble when adding a new post with a "featured image", then the Category tiles disappear
4. Lock the category (or at least pre-select it) when adding a post while being inside a particular category
5. Something is wrong with the log-in. It takes me to the admin part instead of the site itself, and when you want to visit the website, then it takes me back to the log-in again and again. It may have to do with the language plugin
